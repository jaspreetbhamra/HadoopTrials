# HadoopTrials
A repository of basic MapReduce queries run on the Ted_talks dataset downloaded from Kaggle 
(Link: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks).


Queries run on the Dataset (in order of the numbers assigned to Mapper and Reducer classes and jobs to be run)

1. The percentage of the number of people who commented on a talk with respect to those who viewed it.
2. Display names of the talks grouped together based on the rating given to them.
3. Find the tag that has been associated with the maximum number of talks.
4. Find the total number of views received by talks belonging to the same genre (based on the ratings column).
5. Compare the average number of views obtained by the current talk with the number of views obtained by the most popular 'related' talk.
